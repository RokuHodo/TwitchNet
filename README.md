# TwitchNet
Library for all of the Twitch features, developed for the .NET framework. 

# Branches
- **Master**: This branch can also be thought of as the "stable" branch. This branch will be updated once things have been properly tested to work with high reliability.
- **Experimental**: This is essentially the "beta" branch. This is where all features that are in the process of being implemented will be committed until proven stable. This branch will always compile and run, but has a higher chance of being bug prone. Use with caution.

## Please Note:
This is a work in progress (WIP), and there are many changes and additions that are constantly taking place. I am a one man dev team with a full time job outside of developing this library. At times, progress will be slow. If there are any critical bugs, please report them so fixes will be expedited.
